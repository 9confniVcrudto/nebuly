# Memory by Baddeley, Eysenck and Anderson: A Comprehensive and Accessible Textbook on Human Memory
 
Memory is one of the most fascinating and complex aspects of human cognition. It allows us to store, organize, retrieve and forget information about our past experiences, our knowledge of the world, and our plans for the future. However, memory is not a single unitary system, but rather a collection of different processes and systems that interact and influence each other in various ways.

If you are interested in learning more about memory and how it works, you might want to check out the textbook *Memory* by Alan Baddeley, Michael W. Eysenck and Michael C. Anderson. This book is written by three of the world's leading researchers in the field of memory, who have combined their expertise and style to create a comprehensive and accessible overview of the study of memory and its applications.
 
The book covers all the major topics and concepts in memory research, from the basic characteristics of the various memory systems and how they work, to the broader applications of memory in everyday life, such as autobiographical memory, eyewitness testimony, prospective memory, memory in childhood and aging, amnesia, and improving your memory. The book also provides a clear explanation of the scientific approach to memory, including the methods and techniques used to study memory and the brain, as well as the theories and models that guide our understanding of memory phenomena.
 
The book is designed to be engaging and interesting for students and general readers alike. It uses real-world examples throughout to illustrate how memory relates to our everyday experiences. It also includes many 'try this' demonstrations, points for discussion, and bullet-pointed chapter summaries to help students test their knowledge and comprehension of the material. The book is supported by a companion website featuring extensive online resources for students and lecturers.

Memory is a fascinating topic that deserves your attention. By reading this book, you will gain a deeper insight into how memory works and how it affects your life. You will also learn how to improve your memory skills and avoid common memory errors. Whether you are a student of psychology or just curious about your own mind, this book will provide you with a thorough, accessible, and appealing introduction to the field of memory.
  
## What is memory?
 
Memory is the ability to store and use information over time. It is essential for learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and many other cognitive functions. Memory is not a single entity, but rather a collection of different processes and systems that operate in parallel and interact with each other. Memory can be divided into three main types: sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory.
 
Sensory memory is the brief and transient storage of sensory information, such as visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli. It lasts for less than a second and allows us to perceive the world as a continuous stream of events. Short-term memory is the temporary storage of a limited amount of information for a few seconds or minutes. It allows us to hold information in mind while we perform mental operations on it, such as rehearsing, comparing, or manipulating it. Long-term memory is the relatively permanent storage of a potentially unlimited amount of information for days, months, or years. It allows us to retain and retrieve information about our past experiences, our knowledge of the world, and our plans for the future.
 
However, these three types of memory are not independent of each other. They are closely linked and influenced by various factors, such as attention, encoding, retrieval, interference, forgetting, and emotion. Moreover, long-term memory can be further subdivided into different categories, such as declarative and non-declarative memory, episodic and semantic memory, explicit and implicit memory, and procedural and declarative memory. These categories reflect different aspects of memory function, such as the type of information stored, the way it is acquired and expressed, and the brain regions involved.
  
## Memory and the brain
 
Memory is not located in a single part of the brain, but rather involves multiple brain regions that work together in complex networks. Different types of memory rely on different brain structures and circuits. For example, sensory memory involves the sensory cortexes that process sensory information from the eyes, ears, skin, etc. Short-term memory involves the prefrontal cortex that controls attention and executive functions. Long-term memory involves the medial temporal lobe that includes the hippocampus and adjacent structures that are crucial for forming new memories. Long-term memory also involves the neocortex that stores consolidated memories over time.
 
The study of memory and the brain has been greatly advanced by various methods and techniques that allow researchers to measure brain activity and structure in humans and animals. These methods include neuroimaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI). These techniques can reveal how different brain regions are activated or connected during different memory tasks or conditions. Other methods include neuropsychological studies of patients with brain damage or disease that affect specific brain regions or functions. These studies can reveal how different types of memory are impaired or spared by different types of brain lesions or disorders. Finally, other methods include animal studies that use invasive techniques such as lesions, stimulation, recording, or genetic manipulation of specific brain cells or circuits. These studies can reveal how different brain mechanisms underlie different aspects of memory function.
  
## Short-term memory
 
Short-term memory is the temporary storage of a limited amount of information for a few seconds or minutes. It allows us to hold information in mind while we perform mental operations on it. Short-term memory has several characteristics that distinguish it from other types of memory. First, short-term memory has a limited capacity: it can only store about 7 plus or minus 2 items at a time. This means that we can only remember about 7 digits, letters, words, or chunks of information at once. Second, short-term memory has a limited duration: it can only last for about 15 to 30 seconds without rehearsal or maintenance. This means that we can only keep information in mind for a short period of time before it fades away or is replaced by new information.
 
Short-term memory can be influenced by various factors that can enhance or impair its performance. For example, short-term memory can be improved by chunking: grouping items into meaningful units that reduce the number of items to be remembered. Short-term memory can also be improved by rehearsal: repeating items over and over again to keep them in mind longer. Short-term memory can also be improved by encoding: transforming items
