## Step 2: Extract the mod
 
Once you have downloaded the mod, you need to extract it using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You should see a folder called "MeatBot" inside the archive. Copy this folder and paste it into your Call of Duty 2 main directory. This is usually located at C:\Program Files\Activision\Call of Duty 2\main. If you have installed the game in a different location, you need to find it and paste the folder there.
 
## Step 3: Run the mod
 
To run the mod, you need to launch Call of Duty 2 and go to the multiplayer mode. Then, open the console by pressing the tilde key (~) on your keyboard. Type in "/fs\_game MeatBot" (without quotes) and press enter. This will load the mod files. Then, type in "/map mp\_(map name)" (without quotes) and press enter. This will start a match on the map of your choice. For example, if you want to play on Toujane, type in "/map mp\_toujane". You can also use the map selector in the game menu to choose a map.
 
## Step 4: Enjoy the mod
 
Once you are in a match, you can customize the bot settings by pressing 3 on your keyboard. This will allow you to select a bot or all bots and change their behavior. You can make them wander, stay or follow you. You can also toggle their power-up seeking ability by pressing V and SPACE. To pause the game, press V and C. To add more bots, open the console again and type in "/addbot" (without quotes) and press enter. You can also use "/kickbot" (without quotes) to remove bots.

## Step 5: Learn some tips and tricks
 
Now that you have installed and played the bot zombie mod for Call of Duty 2, you might want to learn some tips and tricks to improve your gameplay and have more fun. Here are some of them:
 
- Use the console commands to customize your match. You can change the number of bots, their difficulty, their names, their weapons and more. To see a list of available commands, type in "/help" (without quotes) in the console.
- Use the bot modes wisely. Depending on the map and the situation, you might want to switch between wander, stay and follow modes. For example, if you want to explore a new area or buy something, you can set the bots to follow you. If you want to defend a certain spot or camp, you can set them to stay. If you want them to spread out and distract the zombies, you can set them to wander.
- Use the power-up seeking option. By default, the bots will try to pick up any power-up they see, such as max ammo, insta-kill or nuke. However, sometimes this can be risky or unnecessary. For example, if you have enough ammo or if there are only a few zombies left, you might not want them to run for a power-up and expose themselves. You can toggle this option by pressing V and SPACE.
- Use the pause option. If you need to take a break or do something else, you can pause the game by pressing V and C. This will freeze everything except for you and your bots. You can resume the game by pressing V and C again.
- Watch some videos or guides online. If you want to learn more about the bot zombie mod for Call of Duty 2, you can watch some videos or guides online that show how to play it, how to use the features and how to complete the missions.
